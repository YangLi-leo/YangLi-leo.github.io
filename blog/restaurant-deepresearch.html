                                <p class="">Multi-agent systems can simulate the natural, collaborative process of human decision-making for restaurant selection.</p>
                            </div>
                        </figure>

                        <p>The idea for this project came from a painfully familiar situation: trying to decide where to eat. I'd open Google Maps with high hopes, only to be buried in a sea of restaurants that all kind of looked the same. The filters? Not helpful. My cravings? Vague at best. Every choice felt like a gamble. Sometimes I'd text a friend for help, and while the conversation would often start with indecision, it usually turned into something more helpful. We'd share tips, recommend places, and even discover new spots through our back-and-forth. In the end, we almost always found somewhere that worked. That's when it hit me—what if I had a smart assistant who actually understood what I wanted, could think through the options, and maybe even talk it out with me like a foodie friend who never gets tired?</p>
                        
                        <p>That led to a core question: how can we build an AI system that mimics how humans decide where to eat—through discussion, reasoning, and using external tools like Google Maps? Most existing AI planning systems rely on rigid workflows, yet real-life decision-making is often spontaneous and conversational. This project explores how a multi-agent system can simulate this natural, collaborative process.</p>
                        
                        <p>To enable this, I leverage an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server to unify various tool-calling APIs and use the CAMEL-AI framework to build agents capable of reasoning, communicating, and acting in a shared environment. The goal is to replicate the casual yet effective way people choose restaurants: search, compare, ask, and refine.</p>
                        
                        <p>This project is inspired by several ideas:</p>
                        
                        <ol>
                            <li>
                                <strong>MCP Servers' Growing Popularity:</strong> Nowadays, MCP servers have become very popular, significantly streamlining the process for developers creating tool-calling functions for large language models (LLMs). For example, I use the Google Maps MCP server in this project, combining seven useful tools—<code>search_nearby</code>, <code>get_place_details</code>, <code>maps_geocode</code>, <code>maps_reverse_geocode</code>, <code>maps_distance_matrix</code>, <code>maps_directions</code>, and <code>maps_elevation</code>—into a single JSON file, which is remarkably efficient.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Mimicking Real-life Decision-making:</strong> When searching for places to eat, I typically use Google Maps and then discuss options with my friends, eventually reaching a satisfying decision. So why not allow AI agents to replicate this same process?
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Encouraging Open-ended Exploration:</strong> I don't believe we necessarily need a rigid workflow for this type of task. Our successful decisions often result from discussions and interactions with external tools like Google. Creating an environment where agents can autonomously explore ideas is crucial. That's why I chose to use CAMEL-AI's framework instead of alternatives like LangChain or AutoGen.
                            </li>
                        </ol>
                        
                        <p>Based on these ideas, my approach was to break down the task into manageable components or, more accurately, recreate my daily decision-making environment for AI agents.</p>
                        
                        <h2>Step-by-step Approach</h2>
                        
                        <p>Firstly, my project is triggered by user prompts. From a product design perspective, it's unrealistic to expect users to write prompts in markdown or clearly specify every need. Therefore, we require a robust reasoning model to thoroughly understand user intentions and needs.</p>
                        
                        <p>Secondly, beyond understanding users, models also need to understand each other. Thus, we applied prompt engineering techniques to ensure the output from the first reasoning model is structured clearly in markdown format. This step significantly enhances the task environment, setting the stage effectively for subsequent role-playing sessions.</p>
                        
                        <p>Thirdly, the project's most crucial component is the role-playing session itself. Since this is my first significant project, I chose a straightforward implementation—directly using CAMEL's pre-defined <code>OwlRolePlaying</code> class. This class involves two roles: a user and an assistant. To conceptualize this, imagine chatting with a friend who happens to be an interactive toolbox. When you share ideas, it executes relevant tools, provides feedback, and reviews its findings—truly an impressive capability. Creating such an environment is indeed essential. I'll demonstrate some examples below. For the assistant role, I highly recommend using a powerful tool-calling model.</p>
                        
                        <p>I also recommend that anyone using this framework take time to carefully read through the conversations between agents. Occasionally, you'll encounter a genuine "Aha!" moment—where the agents demonstrate surprisingly intuitive reasoning or creative insight. These are the sparks that show why this kind of environment matters, and why reinforcement learning could play a key role in making it even better. I'll continue updating this point as the project evolves.</p>
                        
                        <p>Finally, the sessions are constrained to 10 rounds, ensuring the agents maintain high-quality dialogue within a limited context. The assistant's final answer is the output you receive, clearly explaining why a specific restaurant was chosen while offering engaging, meaningful interactions.</p>
                        
                        <h2>Evaluation Methodology</h2>
                        
                        <p>To evaluate the performance of different tools, I tested the same task across four platforms: Google DeepResearch, Perplexity DeepResearch, OpenAI DeepResearch, and Manus (yes—I recently got access). While I don't have a formal benchmark, this comparison offers a practical view of each tool's behavior under the same conditions.</p>
                        
                        <p>To ensure fairness, I used nearly identical prompts across all tools. Since Manus includes a human-in-the-loop design, I first submitted the original prompt to Manus, then incorporated the additional information it requested into a revised version. This slightly modified version was then used as the standard prompt for the other tools, including my own system. Due to current access limitations, I was only able to use Gemini 2.5 Pro Experimental, which unfortunately hit its quota during testing. I'll update my own results as soon as I'm able to rerun the full test.</p>
                        
                        <p>Here's the prompt we used for evaluation:</p>
                        
                        <blockquote>
                            <p>We are a family of three from China visiting Tokyo for the very first time, and we are planning our trip for early October to enjoy the mild autumn weather and seasonal Japanese specialties. Our family includes two adults and one enthusiastic 6-year-old child.</p>
                            
                            <p>We are seeking an extraordinary dinner experience that embodies the authentic essence of Japanese cuisine and culture. Specifically, we are very interested in a dining concept that offers either a sushi omakase or kaiseki course menu—or even a blend of both—highlighting the season's freshest ingredients and the culinary artistry behind each dish. An interactive element, such as an open kitchen or chef's table setting, would be a delightful bonus, allowing us and our child to observe and appreciate the meticulous preparation of the meals.</p>
                            
                            <p>In terms of ambiance, we envision a venue that is both elegant and family-friendly, combining traditional Japanese decor (think tatami seating, ambient lighting, and subtle cultural details) with a modern and comfortable atmosphere suitable for a relaxed evening. Additionally, to make our dining experience more accessible and enjoyable, we prefer restaurants that offer menus or service in English or Chinese.</p>
                            
                            <p>Our budget is approximately ¥8,000 to ¥15,000 per person, and we are looking for a location in a culturally rich, historic area of Tokyo—such as Asakusa or a similarly charming neighborhood—that offers a seamless blend of traditional heritage and modern convenience. We also value the ease of making reservations, so a restaurant that accepts online bookings or where assistance with direct reservations is available would be ideal.</p>
                            
                            <p>Overall, we aim for a dinner experience that not only delights our taste buds with authentic Japanese flavors and seasonal specialties but also immerses us in the cultural traditions and warm hospitality of Japan, making our first visit to Tokyo truly unforgettable.</p>
                        </blockquote>

                                            <h2>An Unforgettable Tokyo Dining Experience for Your Family</h2>

                                            <p>Welcome to Tokyo! We're delighted you're visiting for the first time as a family, especially in early October to enjoy the pleasant autumn weather. We understand you're seeking a special dinner experience that captures the authentic essence of Japanese cuisine and culture, suitable for both adults and your 6-year-old child. We'd be happy to help you craft a truly memorable evening.</p>

                                            <p>Japanese cuisine features wonderful concepts like "omakase" and "kaiseki," both deeply rooted in seasonality. "Omakase," often found in sushi restaurants, means "I'll leave it up to the chef." It's an artistic course where the chef selects the freshest seasonal ingredients of the day to create masterful sushi. "Kaiseki," on the other hand, is a traditional multi-course Japanese dinner, meticulously planned from the seasonal ingredients and beautiful presentation to the harmony with the serving ware and the sequence of dishes. Both offer a profound way to appreciate Japan's rich food culture and seasonal bounty, making them excellent choices for your early October visit.</p>

                                            <p>Finding the perfect restaurant that meets all your criteria—authentic high-quality cuisine, specific ambiance, chef interaction, child-friendliness for a 6-year-old, language support, and budget—requires careful curation. The restaurants suggested below have been selected with your preferences in mind, aiming to make your first family dinner in Tokyo truly special.</p>

                                            <h3>Beyond Asakusa: Exploring Tokyo's Charming Historic Districts for Food Lovers</h3>

                                            <p>First, let's touch upon Asakusa, your benchmark for the desired area. Asakusa is renowned for its historical charm and vibrant atmosphere, home to the iconic Senso-ji Temple and traditional food stalls. However, Tokyo boasts other districts that share this culturally rich, historic ambiance.</p>

                                            <h4>Kagurazaka:</h4>
                                            <p>Once a prominent geisha district, Kagurazaka, sometimes called "Tokyo's Little Paris," offers a stylish yet distinctly traditional atmosphere with remnants of the Edo period. Its stone-paved alleys host a unique blend of traditional ryotei (high-class Japanese restaurants) and modern eateries. It's a culturally rich area known for high-quality dining.</p>

                                            <h4>Nihonbashi & Kyobashi:</h4>
                                            <p>Nihonbashi has been a commercial center since the Edo period, blending historical significance with modern sophistication. It's conveniently located near Ginza. Adjacent Kyobashi offers a slightly quieter, more refined atmosphere than Ginza, known for quality dining without the same level of bustle. These areas provide a more mature historical feel than Asakusa, steeped in culinary tradition.</p>

                                            <h4>Kanda:</h4>
                                            <p>Located near Akihabara but with its own distinct character, Kanda mixes historical elements with modern development. It offers good accessibility and, more recently, has seen the emergence of newer restaurant styles actively welcoming international visitors.</p>

                                            <p>When considering these districts for a family, nuances emerge. Asakusa, while historically charming, tends to offer either very traditional establishments or more casual options. Kagurazaka's blend of tradition and modernity might yield restaurants that are elegant yet relaxed, offering modern comforts. Nihonbashi and Kyobashi, while possessing history and quality, also have strong business district aspects, meaning restaurants might lean towards adult or corporate dining. Kanda, however, offers accessibility and potentially newer establishments more consciously catering to families. Therefore, focusing on areas like Kagurazaka, Kanda, or Kyobashi might increase the chances of finding a restaurant that balances historical ambiance with family-friendly comfort and modern elements.</p>

                                            <h4>Recommendation 2: Kyobashi Sushi Hisada</h4>
                                            <p><strong>Restaurant & District:</strong> Kyobashi Sushi Hisada (京橋 寿司 ひさ田). Located in Kyobashi, adjacent to Nihonbashi and Ginza. Excellent access, just a short walk from Kyobashi subway station.</p>

The availability of private rooms for 2, 4, or 6 people makes it a strong contender for families needing a private space. While a specific children's menu isn't mentioned, the welcoming policy and private rooms are positive factors for dining with a 6-year-old.

                                            <h3>Final Recommendation</h3>

                                            <p>Both restaurants offer exceptional dining experiences that meet your criteria. However, if I were to recommend one based on your specific needs:</p>

                                            <p><strong>For a family with a 6-year-old child visiting Tokyo for the first time, Sushi Shiina in Kanda would be my top recommendation.</strong> While slightly higher in price, it offers the most comprehensive family-friendly package: a dedicated children's menu, explicit child-welcoming policy, private rooms ideal for families, and extensive language support including Chinese. The location in Kanda provides a nice balance of historical character and modern accessibility, making it easier to navigate with a child. The "Osho Omakase Course" offers a complete Japanese culinary experience with the interactive element you desire, allowing your family to witness the artistry of sushi-making up close.</p>

                                            <p>That said, if budget is a primary concern, Kyobashi Sushi Hisada offers excellent value with courses starting at ¥8,800, still providing a high-quality authentic experience in a family-friendly setting.</p>

                                            <p>Whichever you choose, I recommend making reservations at least 2-3 weeks in advance for your early October visit, as this is a popular season for dining in Tokyo. Both restaurants will provide an authentic, memorable Japanese dining experience that balances culinary excellence with family-friendly comfort—perfect for creating lasting memories of your first Tokyo visit.</p>

                        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                        
                        <p>This project demonstrates the potential of multi-agent systems to simulate human-like decision-making processes. By leveraging MCP servers and the CAMEL-AI framework, I've created a system that can understand complex user needs, reason through options, and provide thoughtful recommendations in a conversational manner.</p>
                        
                        <p>The comparison with other AI tools highlights both the strengths and areas for improvement in my approach. While Google and OpenAI DeepResearch provide comprehensive, well-structured responses, and Perplexity offers a more concise analysis, my system aims to combine the best of both worlds: detailed information with interactive reasoning.</p>
                        
                        <h2>Future Directions</h2>
                        
                        <ol>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Enhanced Tool Integration:</strong> Expanding the range of tools available to agents, such as reservation systems, review aggregators, and real-time availability checkers.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Improved Multi-turn Conversations:</strong> Developing more sophisticated dialogue management to handle follow-up questions and clarifications naturally.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>User Preference Learning:</strong> Implementing mechanisms for the system to learn and remember user preferences over time, creating more personalized recommendations.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Evaluation Framework:</strong> Developing a more rigorous evaluation methodology to assess the quality and usefulness of recommendations.
                            </li>
                        </ol>
                        
                        <p>By continuing to refine this approach, I believe we can create AI systems that not only provide information but truly assist in decision-making processes in a way that feels natural and helpful to users.</p>
