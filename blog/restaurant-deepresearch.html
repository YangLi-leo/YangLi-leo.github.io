                    <p>
                        The idea for this project came from a painfully familiar situation: trying to decide where to eat. I'd open Google Maps with high hopes, only to be buried in a sea of restaurants that all kind of looked the same. The filters? Not helpful. My cravings? Vague at best. Every choice felt like a gamble. Sometimes I'd text a friend for help, and while the conversation would often start with indecision, it usually turned into something more helpful. We'd share tips, recommend places, and even discover new spots through our back-and-forth. In the end, we almost always found somewhere that worked. That's when it hit me—what if I had a smart assistant who actually understood what I wanted, could think through the options, and maybe even talk it out with me like a foodie friend who never gets tired?
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        That led to a core question: how can we build an AI system that mimics how humans decide where to eat—through discussion, reasoning, and using external tools like Google Maps? Most existing AI planning systems rely on rigid workflows, yet real-life decision-making is often spontaneous and conversational. This project explores how a multi-agent system can simulate this natural, collaborative process.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        To enable this, I leverage an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server to unify various tool-calling APIs and use the CAMEL-AI framework to build agents capable of reasoning, communicating, and acting in a shared environment. The goal is to replicate the casual yet effective way people choose restaurants: search, compare, ask, and refine.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        This project is inspired by several ideas:
                    </p>
                    
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            <strong>MCP Servers' Growing Popularity:</strong> Nowadays, MCP servers have become very popular, significantly streamlining the process for developers creating tool-calling functions for large language models (LLMs). For example, I use the Google Maps MCP server in this project, combining seven useful tools—<code>search_nearby</code>, <code>get_place_details</code>, <code>maps_geocode</code>, <code>maps_reverse_geocode</code>, <code>maps_distance_matrix</code>, <code>maps_directions</code>, and <code>maps_elevation</code>—into a single JSON file, which is remarkably efficient.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Mimicking Real-life Decision-making:</strong> When searching for places to eat, I typically use Google Maps and then discuss options with my friends, eventually reaching a satisfying decision. So why not allow AI agents to replicate this same process?
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Encouraging Open-ended Exploration:</strong> I don't believe we necessarily need a rigid workflow for this type of task. Our successful decisions often result from discussions and interactions with external tools like Google. Creating an environment where agents can autonomously explore ideas is crucial. That's why I chose to use CAMEL-AI's framework instead of alternatives like LangChain or AutoGen.
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                    
                    <p>
                        Based on these ideas, my approach was to break down the task into manageable components or, more accurately, recreate my daily decision-making environment for AI agents.
                    </p>
                    
                    <h2>Step-by-step Approach</h2>
                    
                    <p>
                        Firstly, my project is triggered by user prompts. From a product design perspective, it's unrealistic to expect users to write prompts in markdown or clearly specify every need. Therefore, we require a robust reasoning model to thoroughly understand user intentions and needs.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        Secondly, beyond understanding users, models also need to understand each other. Thus, we applied prompt engineering techniques to ensure the output from the first reasoning model is structured clearly in markdown format. This step significantly enhances the task environment, setting the stage effectively for subsequent role-playing sessions.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        Thirdly, the project's most crucial component is the role-playing session itself. Since this is my first significant project, I chose a straightforward implementation—directly using CAMEL's pre-defined <code>OwlRolePlaying</code> class. This class involves two roles: a user and an assistant. To conceptualize this, imagine chatting with a friend who happens to be an interactive toolbox. When you share ideas, it executes relevant tools, provides feedback, and reviews its findings—truly an impressive capability. Creating such an environment is indeed essential. I'll demonstrate some examples below. For the assistant role, I highly recommend using a powerful tool-calling model.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        I also recommend that anyone using this framework take time to carefully read through the conversations between agents. Occasionally, you'll encounter a genuine "Aha!" moment—where the agents demonstrate surprisingly intuitive reasoning or creative insight. These are the sparks that show why this kind of environment matters, and why reinforcement learning could play a key role in making it even better. I'll continue updating this point as the project evolves.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        Finally, the sessions are constrained to 10 rounds, ensuring the agents maintain high-quality dialogue within a limited context. The assistant's final answer is the output you receive, clearly explaining why a specific restaurant was chosen while offering engaging, meaningful interactions.
                    </p>
                    
                    <h2>Evaluation Methodology</h2>
                    
                    <p>
                        To evaluate the performance of different tools, I tested the same task across four platforms: Google DeepResearch, Perplexity DeepResearch, OpenAI DeepResearch, and Manus (yes—I recently got access). While I don't have a formal benchmark, this comparison offers a practical view of each tool's behavior under the same conditions.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        To ensure fairness, I used nearly identical prompts across all tools. Since Manus includes a human-in-the-loop design, I first submitted the original prompt to Manus, then incorporated the additional information it requested into a revised version. This slightly modified version was then used as the standard prompt for the other tools, including my own system. Due to current access limitations, I was only able to use Gemini 2.5 Pro Experimental, which unfortunately hit its quota during testing. I'll update my own results as soon as I'm able to rerun the full test.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        Here's the prompt we used for evaluation:
                    </p>
                    
                    <blockquote>
                        <p>We are a family of three from China visiting Tokyo for the very first time, and we are planning our trip for early October to enjoy the mild autumn weather and seasonal Japanese specialties. Our family includes two adults and one enthusiastic 6-year-old child.</p>
                        
                        <p>We are seeking an extraordinary dinner experience that embodies the authentic essence of Japanese cuisine and culture. Specifically, we are very interested in a dining concept that offers either a sushi omakase or kaiseki course menu—or even a blend of both—highlighting the season's freshest ingredients and the culinary artistry behind each dish. An interactive element, such as an open kitchen or chef's table setting, would be a delightful bonus, allowing us and our child to observe and appreciate the meticulous preparation of the meals.</p>
                        
                        <p>In terms of ambiance, we envision a venue that is both elegant and family-friendly, combining traditional Japanese decor (think tatami seating, ambient lighting, and subtle cultural details) with a modern and comfortable atmosphere suitable for a relaxed evening. Additionally, to make our dining experience more accessible and enjoyable, we prefer restaurants that offer menus or service in English or Chinese.</p>
                        
                        <p>Our budget is approximately ¥8,000 to ¥15,000 per person, and we are looking for a location in a culturally rich, historic area of Tokyo—such as Asakusa or a similarly charming neighborhood—that offers a seamless blend of traditional heritage and modern convenience. We also value the ease of making reservations, so a restaurant that accepts online bookings or where assistance with direct reservations is available would be ideal.</p>
                        
                        <p>Overall, we aim for a dinner experience that not only delights our taste buds with authentic Japanese flavors and seasonal specialties but also immerses us in the cultural traditions and warm hospitality of Japan, making our first visit to Tokyo truly unforgettable.</p>

<h2>An Unforgettable Tokyo Dining Experience for Your Family</h2>

<p>Welcome to Tokyo! We're delighted you're visiting for the first time as a family, especially in early October to enjoy the pleasant autumn weather. We understand you're seeking a special dinner experience that captures the authentic essence of Japanese cuisine and culture, suitable for both adults and your 6-year-old child. We'd be happy to help you craft a truly memorable evening.</p>

<p>Japanese cuisine features wonderful concepts like "omakase" and "kaiseki," both deeply rooted in seasonality. "Omakase," often found in sushi restaurants, means "I'll leave it up to the chef." It's an artistic course where the chef selects the freshest seasonal ingredients of the day to create masterful sushi. "Kaiseki," on the other hand, is a traditional multi-course Japanese dinner, meticulously planned from the seasonal ingredients and beautiful presentation to the harmony with the serving ware and the sequence of dishes. Both offer a profound way to appreciate Japan's rich food culture and seasonal bounty, making them excellent choices for your early October visit.</p>

    <p>Finding the perfect restaurant that meets all your criteria—authentic high-quality cuisine, specific ambiance, chef interaction, child-friendliness for a 6-year-old, language support, and budget—requires careful curation. The restaurants suggested below have been selected with your preferences in mind, aiming to make your first family dinner in Tokyo truly special.</p>

<h3>Beyond Asakusa: Exploring Tokyo's Charming Historic Districts for Food Lovers</h3>

<p>First, let's touch upon Asakusa, your benchmark for the desired area. Asakusa is renowned for its historical charm and vibrant atmosphere, home to the iconic Senso-ji Temple and traditional food stalls. However, Tokyo boasts other districts that share this culturally rich, historic ambiance.</p>

<h4>Kagurazaka:</h4>
                        <p>Once a prominent geisha district, Kagurazaka, sometimes called "Tokyo's Little Paris," offers a stylish yet distinctly traditional atmosphere with remnants of the Edo period. Its stone-paved alleys host a unique blend of traditional ryotei (high-class Japanese restaurants) and modern eateries. It's a culturally rich area known for high-quality dining.</p>

                        <h4>Nihonbashi & Kyobashi:</h4>
                        <p>Nihonbashi has been a commercial center since the Edo period, blending historical significance with modern sophistication. It's conveniently located near Ginza. Adjacent Kyobashi offers a slightly quieter, more refined atmosphere than Ginza, known for quality dining without the same level of bustle. These areas provide a more mature historical feel than Asakusa, steeped in culinary tradition.</p>

                        <h4>Kanda:</h4>
                        <p>Located near Akihabara but with its own distinct character, Kanda mixes historical elements with modern development. It offers good accessibility and, more recently, has seen the emergence of newer restaurant styles actively welcoming international visitors.</p>

                        <p>When considering these districts for a family, nuances emerge. Asakusa, while historically charming, tends to offer either very traditional establishments or more casual options. Kagurazaka's blend of tradition and modernity might yield restaurants that are elegant yet relaxed, offering modern comforts. Nihonbashi and Kyobashi, while possessing history and quality, also have strong business district aspects, meaning restaurants might lean towards adult or corporate dining. Kanda, however, offers accessibility and potentially newer establishments more consciously catering to families. Therefore, focusing on areas like Kagurazaka, Kanda, or Kyobashi might increase the chances of finding a restaurant that balances historical ambiance with family-friendly comfort and modern elements.</p>

                        <h3>Curated Restaurant Recommendations for Your Special Family Evening</h3>

                        <p>The following two restaurants have been carefully selected considering all your criteria: omakase sushi, budget (¥8,000-¥15,000 per person), ambiance, suitability for a 6-year-old, chef interaction, location in a historic/charming area, language support, and ease of reservation.</p>
                        <h4>Recommendation 1: Sushi Shiina (Kanda)</h4>
                        <p><strong>Restaurant & District:</strong> Sushi Shiina (鮨 しいな). Located in the Kanda district, easily accessible from JR Kanda or Shin-Nihonbashi stations.</p>
                        <p><strong>Culinary Journey:</strong> Offers an "Osho Omakase Course" for dinner at ¥15,000 (tax included), fitting your budget. This course features 18 items, including 12 pieces of nigiri, a roll, soup, dessert, plus seasonal appetizers and sashimi. They emphasize fresh, seasonal ingredients procured daily by experienced chefs, promising autumn delicacies in early October. Counter seats allow for watching the chefs' skills up close, fulfilling the interactive element. Private counter rooms are also available.</p>
                        <p><strong>Ambiance & Space:</strong> Described as having an elegant, calm Japanese atmosphere that is also relaxing. Features counter seating, table seating, and private rooms with counters. The availability of private rooms is a significant plus for families seeking privacy. Photos suggest a clean, modern Japanese aesthetic.</p>
                        <p><strong>Family Hospitality:</strong> Explicitly welcomes children of all ages, and strollers are permitted. They offer a children's menu (tamagoyaki, chawanmushi, etc.) available for order on the day. Private rooms are ideal for families with young children. Reviews mention suitability for family use. Note: Private counter rooms may incur a separate fee for parties of 2 or fewer, but this typically wouldn't apply to a family of three.</p>
                        <p><strong>Language & Access:</strong> English and Korean menus are available.

                        <h4>Recommendation 2: Kyobashi Sushi Hisada</h4>

<h3>Reservations and Final Thoughts</h3>

<p>For your October trip, especially during a popular season, we strongly recommend making reservations as soon as you decide on a restaurant. When booking, mention you have a 6-year-old child and confirm seating arrangements (counter vs. private/table) and any specific child policies. Utilize the provided website links and reservation platforms (Tabelog, TableCheck, Japan Food Guide, etc.). Be sure to check cancellation policies and inquire about notifying them of allergies or dietary restrictions in advance. Some establishments appreciate guests refraining from strong perfumes, adhering to a smart casual dress code, and being punctual.</p>

<p>In these special dining experiences, respecting the chef's pace and enjoying the cuisine quietly are considered refined manners. For families, a private room can offer a more relaxed environment without worrying about disturbing other guests.</p>

<p>We hope your first trip to Tokyo is wonderful! May you create lasting family memories over an authentic, culturally rich, and delicious meal at one of these establishments. Enjoy your special evening in Tokyo!</p>

<h2>Family-Friendly Authentic Japanese Dining Experiences in Asakusa: A Guide for First-Time Visitors</h2>

<p>As your family prepares for an October visit to Tokyo, you're poised to experience the perfect blend of mild autumn weather and seasonal Japanese culinary delights. Based on your desire for an extraordinary dining experience that balances authenticity, family-friendliness, and cultural immersion, I've compiled a comprehensive guide to help make your first Tokyo dinner truly unforgettable.</p>

<h3>Seasonal Dining in Asakusa: Embracing Autumn Flavors</h3>

  <p>Visiting Tokyo in early October places you squarely in the middle of autumn's bounty. Japanese cuisine celebrates seasonality like few others, and this time of year brings particularly prized ingredients to menus across the city. Seasonal autumn specialties you might encounter include matsutake mushrooms, Pacific saury (sanma), chestnuts (kuri), and persimmons (kaki) – all of which feature prominently in both kaiseki and omakase dining experiences.</p>

 <p>The historic district of Asakusa offers an ideal setting for your culinary adventure, combining cultural heritage with accessibility. With its iconic Sensō-ji Temple, traditional architecture, and vibrant atmosphere, Asakusa provides the perfect backdrop for an authentic Japanese dining experience while remaining family-friendly.</p>

<h3>Recommended Dining Establishments for Families</h3>

<h4>Osushiawase Sushi Horikawa</h4>

<p>Tucked away on a quiet backstreet of Asakusa, Osushiawase Sushi Horikawa offers an intimate dining experience that beautifully balances tradition with accessibility. This sushi counter opened in February 2024 and has already gained recognition for its exceptional approach to seasonal ingredients.</p>

<p><strong>Key Features:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Intimate six-seat counter setting allowing close observation of the chef's techniques</li>
    <li>Chef's personal selection of seasonal ingredients from across Japan</li>
    <li>Unique sushi rice blend of "Sasanishiki" and "Koshihikari" varieties</li>
    <li>Interactive experience with chef sharing stories behind ingredients and techniques</li>
    <li>Located approximately 8 minutes' walk from Asakusa Station</li>
</ul>

 <p>The pricing ranges from ¥10,000-15,000 per person based on reviews, fitting within your specified budget. Though small, the interactive nature of the counter seating provides an entertaining element that might engage your child while introducing them to authentic Japanese culinary craftsmanship.</p>

<h4>Tsukiji Sushisen Asaku</h4>

<p>While specific details are limited in the search results, Tsukiji Sushisen Asaku is mentioned as another quality omakase option in Asakusa that offers high-value lunch omakase experiences at reasonable prices. This could be an excellent alternative if you're looking for a slightly less formal atmosphere while still experiencing authentic Edomae sushi.</p>

<h4>Manten Sushi</h4>

<p>Recommended by several knowledgeable diners, Manten Sushi offers a 7,000 yen omakase that is described as "literally a steal given the quality you get". With several locations across Tokyo, including accessible options from the Asakusa area, this restaurant provides an excellent introduction to omakase dining without breaking your budget.</p>

<p><strong>Key Features:</strong></p>
<ul>
     <li>High-quality omakase at ¥7,000 per person</li>
    <li>Multiple locations across Tokyo</li>
    <li>Advance reservations required</li>
    <li>Great value-to-quality ratio</li>
</ul>

<p>This option might be particularly suitable for families with children experiencing omakase for the first time, as the price point allows for a premium experience without the pressure of an ultra-high-end establishment.</p>

<h3>Family-Friendly Alternatives with Private Rooms</h3>

<p>For families concerned about a young child in a formal sushi counter environment, several establishments in Asakusa offer private dining rooms with authentic Japanese cuisine:</p>

<h4>Itto Gai Yakiniku Gen Asakusa Main Branch</h4>

<p>Located just one minute from Asakusa Station, this establishment specializes in premium A5-grade wagyu beef while offering private rooms ideal for family dining.</p>

<p><strong>Key Features:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Private rooms available for families</li>
    <li>A5-grade kuroge wagyu beef</li>
    <li>Family-friendly kotatsu-style seating</li>
    <li>Refillable side dishes including kimchi and vegetables</li>
    <li>Conveniently located near major Asakusa attractions</li>
</ul>

  <p>While this isn't omakase or kaiseki, it offers an interactive Japanese dining experience where your family can grill premium meats at your table – an engaging activity that might delight your 6-year-old while still providing an authentic taste of Japanese cuisine.</p>

<h2>Exceptional Sushi & Kaiseki Dining in Tokyo's Historic Districts</h2>

    <p>Visiting Tokyo's old-town neighborhoods offers the chance to dine on sushi and kaiseki in settings rich with tradition. Below we highlight top restaurants in areas like Asakusa, Ueno, and Nihonbashi that deliver authentic cuisine, seasonal artistry, and a family-friendly cultural experience. Each meets your budget of ¥8,000–¥15,000 per person and welcomes children, with English (and often Chinese) support. We've also included a comparison table and reservation info for each recommendation.</p>

        <h3>Inshotei (韻松亭) – Ueno Park</h3>

<p><strong>Cuisine & Experience:</strong> A traditional kaiseki restaurant established in 1875 inside Ueno Park's grounds. Inshotei serves multi-course seasonal cuisine, with an emphasis on fresh vegetables, tofu, and soy-based dishes prepared in the Kyoto style. The courses are artfully presented to reflect the season, offering an edible journey through Japanese aesthetics. For example, their tiered bento lunches and seasonal kaiseki courses showcase ingredients like mountain greens in spring or chestnuts in autumn, arranged beautifully in lacquerware and ceramic dishes.</p>

   <p><strong>Ambiance:</strong> Housed in a century-old wooden teahouse overlooking Ueno's Shinobazu Pond, Inshotei provides an elegant, traditional decor with tatami-mat rooms and garden views. In the evening, lantern lighting and shoji screens create a serene atmosphere reminiscent of Meiji-era Tokyo. (The haiku poet Bashō even referenced Ueno's blossoms and temple bell, underscoring the location's cultural resonance.) Despite the classic setting, the vibe is relaxed and family-friendly – you'll see local families and tourists alike enjoying the ambiance.</p>

<p><strong>Interactivity:</strong> While there isn't an open kitchen visible to diners (kaiseki is served course-by-course in private rooms or semi-private tables), the presentation itself is engaging. Staff often explain each dish's ingredients and symbolism (in English, if needed), which can captivate an older child. The restaurant's history and setting also offer a chance to discuss Japanese culture with your 6-year-old as you dine. In warmer months, you might stroll through the surrounding park before or after dinner, adding to the cultural experience.</p>

     <p><strong>Family Friendliness:</strong> Inshotei welcomes children and even offers a kids' menu/course (approx ¥1,900). For instance, they have a special lunch bento for kids, and an English menu is available so you can easily choose child-friendly items. High chairs can be provided upon request. The serene setting means children should be able to sit calmly, but the private-room layout helps keep your family comfortable. (Upstairs rooms have low tables with horigotatsu – sunken floor seating – offering comfort for those not used to sitting on the floor.)</p>

<p><strong>Language & Service:</strong> Inshotei is very foreigner-friendly. They have an English website and menu, staff can communicate in English, and they even provide menus in Chinese. Many international visitors come here, so you'll feel welcome. Service is polite and attentive, happy to accommodate requests (they can adjust dishes for certain dietary needs if informed).</p>

<p><strong>Reservations:</strong> Reservations are recommended, especially for dinner and for private rooms. You can book online via TableCheck in English. (Inshotei's official website has a TableCheck link for easy booking.) They also accept phone reservations, but online is easier for non-Japanese speakers. Same-day walk-ins are possible at lunch, but for a special dinner, be sure to reserve.</p>

          <p><strong>Why Inshotei?</strong> This restaurant offers an immersive dive into traditional Japanese dining – from its park-side historic teahouse setting to its seasonal kaiseki artistry. It's within your budget (dinner courses range roughly ¥7,800–¥14,800) and provides a memorable cultural atmosphere that both adults and a curious child will appreciate. As one review noted, "English menu is available… We sat on the 2nd floor with views of trees… a very special experience.". Inshotei perfectly balances authenticity with warmth, making a family's first kaiseki experience in Tokyo smooth and unforgettable.</p>

              <h3>Asakusa Kaminarimon Wakashika (浅草 雷門 若鹿) – Asakusa</h3>

     <p><strong>Cuisine & Experience:</strong> Wakashika is one of the oldest restaurants in Asakusa, famed for its traditional kaiseki cuisine with a twist. Their omakase kaiseki courses feature gorgeously plated seasonal ingredients – each dish a small work of art reflecting the time of year. Uniquely, Wakashika incorporates a shabu-shabu hotpot into their kaiseki: their signature "Wakashika-style" beef and venison hot pot is a must-try, served in a rich, flavorful broth as one course of the meal. This means along with beautifully arranged sashimi and simmered dishes, you get an interactive hotpot experience at your table. The dinner tasting course is around ¥8,640 (a great value for kaiseki), within your budget. You can choose a Wagyu beef or venison shabu-shabu course, or a full kaiseki course that interweaves the hotpot and other seasonal courses. Expect elements like delicate appetizers in painted porcelain, grilled fish garnished with local greenery, and perhaps a rice course cooked in a clay pot – all tailored to early October's ingredients (think matsutake mushrooms, persimmons, etc., if in season).</p>

 <p><strong>Ambiance:</strong> Located just a few minutes from Asakusa's famous Kaminarimon gate, Wakashika offers an intimate, traditional ambiance tucked away from the busy streets. Inside, it feels like a "hideout" house restaurant with a calm atmosphere. Décor is classic Japanese: tatami-floored private rooms (with horigotatsu sunken seating for comfort) and an interior courtyard garden view from some rooms. The walls may feature seasonal flower arrangements and artwork. It's the kind of place that's popular for local celebrations, so the setting is elegant yet unpretentious. You'll likely be seated in a semi-private room; one of their dining rooms overlooks a small garden, enhancing the cultural charm.</p>

      <p><strong>Interactivity:</strong> Wakashika's interactive element comes from the shabu-shabu hotpot course. At your table, a server will set up a simmering pot of exquisite dashi broth. You and your family can swish the slices of Wagyu beef or venison in the broth to cook them to your liking – a fun hands-on experience for a 6-year-old (with supervision) that adds a bit of dinnertime entertainment. The chef's meticulous techniques happen in the kitchen, but the staff's presentation of each course – for example, pouring broth from an iron kettle or revealing dishes covered by bamboo lids – provides engaging theater. They might also explain the background of the dishes. This balance of chef's artistry and DIY dining (for the hotpot) keeps everyone involved.</p>

   <p><strong>Family Friendliness:</strong> Wakashika explicitly welcomes families and children of all ages. According to their profile, "Children [including babies and school-age] welcome, strollers welcome.". Private rooms and booths help keep a young one comfortable, and the staff are accommodating – if your child isn't ready for raw sashimi, they may be able to adjust one or two items (do ask; they have an à la carte menu too). The horigotatsu seating means adults can sit Western-style (legs under the table) while still in a tatami room, making it easier on those not used to kneeling. High chairs might not be typical in such places, but a child could sit on cushions comfortably. The atmosphere is quiet and refined, so gentle reminders to use indoor voices may be needed, but many reviews note the setting is suitable for well-behaved kids (and the novelty of the courses usually keeps them interested).</p>

<p><strong>Language & Service:</strong> Wakashika provides multilingual support. They have menus and information in English and Chinese on their website, and even partner with booking services that cater to foreigners. The staff, including the chef-owner, are accustomed to serving international guests. While their English may be basic, they communicate earnestly. An English menu is available on request (and likely a Chinese one as well, given the tourist locale). For important details, they have an English-language Hot Pepper reservation page and a JPNEazy concierge listing, indicating they are experienced with non-Japanese patrons.</p>

  <p><strong>Reservations:</strong> Online reservations can be made via HotPepper or their official site (which offers an English interface). You can also call (they have staff who can handle basic English calls). Same-day bookings might be possible on weekdays, but to be safe, reserve ahead for an October dinner – especially as they have limited private rooms. No deposit is required if booking via HotPepper or phone. (JPNEazy can also reserve for you with a small fee.) Wakashika has been around ~55 years in its current form, and its blend of kaiseki and hotpot is popular. Early evening slots (6 pm) may be easier with a child, and they are open by 5 pm most nights.</p>

  <p><strong>Why Wakashika?</strong> It delivers a memorable, only-in-Japan experience by combining kaiseki artistry with a mini shabu-shabu adventure. You'll enjoy an authentic seasonal feast (beautiful to behold and delicious) in a charming Asakusa setting, without worrying about breaking etiquette with a child in tow. In fact, with private seating and a receptive staff, your family can relax and savor the meal. As Savor Japan's guide notes, "For Japan's traditional kaiseki haute cuisine, look no further than Wakashika… gorgeously plated dishes of seasonal ingredients. Don't miss their beef and venison hot pot." It's an excellent choice to immerse yourselves in Japanese cuisine and hospitality near Sensoji Temple.</p>

<h3>Booking Tips</h3>

<p>For your October trip, especially during a popular season, we strongly recommend making reservations as soon as you decide on a restaurant. When booking, mention you have a 6-year-old child and confirm seating arrangements (counter vs. private/table) and any specific child policies. Utilize the provided website links and reservation platforms (Tabelog, TableCheck, Japan Food Guide, etc.). Be sure to check cancellation policies and inquire about notifying them of allergies or dietary restrictions in advance. Some establishments appreciate guests refraining from strong perfumes, adhering to a smart casual dress code, and being punctual.</p>

   <p>By choosing any of these restaurants, you'll be treating your family to an authentic Japanese dinner in a storied Tokyo neighborhood. Each offers seasonal cuisine presented with artistry, an ambiance that blends tradition with comfort, and a warm welcome to visitors of all ages. From watching a sushi master shape nigiri in front of you to savoring kaiseki courses in a tatami room, you'll create memories that capture the spirit of Japan. Enjoy your trip in early October, and itadakimasu – bon appétit!</p>

                        <li>
                            Initially, upon choosing CAMEL's framework, I instinctively wanted to design explicit workflows (decomposing large tasks into smaller subtasks, assigning individual agents, and finally synthesizing the results). Being stuck on this approach delayed the project by 2-3 days.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Through A/B testing, I assessed whether foundational models significantly impacted results. Starting with Gemini 2.0 Flash and then upgrading to Gemini 2.5 Pro Experimental, I observed considerable improvement in both the quality of results and the role-playing interactions. Interestingly, Gemini 1.5 Pro frequently attempted to invoke external tools despite clear prompt instructions, whereas Gemini 2.5 Pro resolved this issue entirely. Overall, Gemini 2.5 Pro proved extremely effective.

                        <li>
                            I attempted adding a critic role to the session, but due to possible misconfiguration, this resulted in infinite loops.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            As a beginner in programming, uploading my project to GitHub was challenging. Despite using Docker to streamline the process, I encountered persistent issues, particularly with errors stating my Google Maps API key was invalid.
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                    
                    <h2>Areas for Improvement</h2>
                    
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            While Google Maps MCP server is robust, integrating additional tools could enhance results further.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            During role-playing sessions, agents occasionally expressed uncertainty regarding user requirements, proceeding based on assumptions. Thus, incorporating human-in-the-loop interactions—where agents actively seek additional details from humans—could greatly enhance research depth. During tests comparing my project with other deep research tools such as Manus, OpenAI, Google, and Perplexity, we found that both Manus and OpenAI have automatic human-in-the-loop processes. They can proactively ask the user for missing information instead of relying on the user to modify their plan. This ability is clearly valuable and highlights the importance of such a process.

                            Although I haven't precisely measured the cost per search, based on observation, it appears expensive. Improving efficiency remains crucial.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Addressing points 2 and 3, developing a customized Roleplay class is essential, and this work is underway.

                    <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
                    
                    <p>
                        AI Agents will significantly reshape the AI market landscape. However, we shouldn't impose human-centric thinking when designing AI systems. While LLMs exhibit human-like qualities, they follow fundamentally different rules. Thus, it's important to provide environments tailored specifically to AI agents, allowing them to reach their full potential. Rigid workflows may no longer be optimal; instead, we should leverage flexible environments to foster positive outcomes. My next project will explore this philosophy further.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        Also, with Google's recent release of A2A, we are witnessing even greater potential for a sophisticated Multi-Agent web ecosystem. Let's keep pushing the boundaries.
